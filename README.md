# Memory Game

This game is second project of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. It is written using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Instructions

Click on two cards from the presented deck. You will see a symbol on each card. If they are the same you have your first match and cards stay open till the end of the game. If not, cards will flip back giving you another chance. Try to remember symbols and their location. Continue flipping cards, trying to find the matching symbols.

Your final result depends on finding all pairs, time and star score.
Timer starts once the first card is clicked and stops when all cards are matched.
Stars score are a result of the number of moves you made to find a match. As the move counter goes up, a rating system will be triggered. Up to 15 moves you will get 3 stars. Between 16 and 24 you will get 2 stars. Above 24 you will get 1 star.

Game ends when all cards are open. You will see a pop-up window which will notify you about that, showing your game result. You can play again by clicking “Play again” button.
If not, click the “Cancel” button.
